The results of the sorting algorithms were similar to what I expected. After running it a few times, I got slightly different results based on the size of the data set. After running the same data sets multiple times I also saw different results. I thought Bubble Sort would have the longest running time so I was surprised to see that Quick Sort had the longest runtime. However that does make sense because Quick Sort does have a large affect on the processor and therefore creates a slower runtime. I also did have problems with the way I set up time so there is a chance that my results are incorrect. Bubble sort and Selection Sort had the quickest runtime which is surprising because they are the worst sorting methods to used with data. I created my sorting algorithms based on class notes and book notes which shows the best way to implement the algorithms but my method of putting the file into the array could have made it take longer. I think the biggest short coming was the timestamp of the algorithm. I am not sure if the runtime I got was accurate so it may be causing skewed results. I also know that pointers are risky to use when using C++ so that may have altered results with the runtime.
